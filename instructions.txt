Step-by-Step Guide:

Preparation and Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Terraform, Ansible, and AWS CLI installed on your system.

Configure AWS CLI:
If not already configured, run aws configure and follow the prompts to set up your AWS credentials.

Create Ansible Playbook:
Save the Ansible playbook content provided above to a file named setup_kali.yml.

Modify Terraform Script:
Update the Terraform script (main.tf) with the correct Kali Linux AMI ID, key pair name, and the path to your private key file (/path/to/my-key-pair.pem).
Adjust the instance count and configurations as needed.

Initialize Terraform:
Run terraform init in your terminal to initialize Terraform in the directory containing your Terraform script and Ansible playbook.

Review Terraform Plan (Optional):
Run terraform plan to see a plan of what Terraform will do. Review the plan to ensure it matches your expectations.

Apply Terraform Configuration:
Execute terraform apply to create the specified number of EC2 instances and configure them with Ansible.
Confirm by typing yes when prompted.

Monitor Provisioning:
Terraform will begin creating the EC2 instances and configuring them with Ansible. 
Monitor the progress in your terminal.

Verify Instances:
After Terraform completes, verify in the AWS Management Console that the EC2 instances have been created with the specified configurations and tags.

Access Instances (Optional):
If needed, SSH into the instances using your private key to verify the configurations and access the deployed tools.
With this setup, Terraform will handle the creation and configuration of EC2 instances, while Ansible will take care of configuring the instances with the specified tools. 
Adjust the configurations and playbook tasks as needed for your specific use case.
